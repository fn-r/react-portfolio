## Optimizations
I would further improve this project by implementing a skeleton design for handling loading of data or those with slow internet access.

## Lesson Learned
- Separation of concern:
    There's only two pages for this project. Although I can separate each section of the *Home* page into different components, it would be considered unneccessary as only one page is using it. Therefore, each section was separated into a function within the same page to easily make changes to a section in the future.
- Handling no route:
    Users' can manually go to a non-existing path. User will be navigated to the *Not Found* page to notify users that this path does not exist.
- File Structure:
    Each file in this project are group according to their usage. This is a common practice to follow in a large project.
